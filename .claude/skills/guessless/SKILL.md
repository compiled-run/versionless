description: Prove structural claims about JavaScript/TypeScript with a guessless receipt. Use when about to say "all call sites", "every reference", "nothing else imports this", or "safe to delete"; when renaming or deleting an exported symbol; when a claim gate has blocked a turn asking for a receipt; or when auditing whether a change is complete. Do not use for non-JS/TS languages.

# Proving a structural claim with guessless

Guessless answers reference/definition/reachability questions about JavaScript and TypeScript and
returns a signed receipt that is either exhaustive or explicitly incomplete. It never returns a bare
list, so every answer is either usable as proof or self-labelled as a gap.

## 1. Build the query envelope

Guessless is hermetic: it reads sources out of the envelope, not off disk. That is what makes a
receipt reproducible later.

```json
{
	"inputs": [{ "path": "src/storage.ts", "source": "<file contents>" }],
	"request": { "kind": "exportedNames", "file": "src/storage.ts" }
}
```

Include every file that could plausibly reference the symbol. A file you leave out is not a file
guessless says is clean — it is a file guessless never saw.

Request kinds:

| Kind                        | Fields                                    | Answers                      |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `referencesOf`              | `target` (symbol anchor)                  | Every reference to a symbol  |
| `definitionOf`              | `target`                                  | Where a symbol is defined    |
| `readsOf` / `writesOf`      | `target`                                  | Reads or writes of a binding |
| `capturesOf`                | `target`                                  | Closures capturing a binding |
| `reachableFrom` / `reaches` | `target`                                  | Call-graph reachability      |
| `exportedNames`             | `file`                                    | The module's export surface  |
| `resolveBinding`            | `file`, `name`, `space`, optional `scope` | What a name resolves to      |

Get a symbol anchor from an `exportedNames` or `definitionOf` receipt and pass it back verbatim —
anchors are fingerprinted, so hand-editing one invalidates it.

## 2. Run it

```bash
npx guessless query envelope.json > answer.receipt.json
```

## 3. Read the receipt honestly

- `"state": "complete"` — say "all", and paste or cite the receipt.
- `"state": "partial"` — every place the engine could not classify is named in `unresolved`. Say the
  answer is partial, give the count, and name the gaps. Do not round a partial up to "all".
- `"state": "refused"` — `reason` and `detail` say why. Do not claim anything; fix the cause (often a
  non-JS/TS file) and re-query.

## 4. Make it checkable

Write the receipt beside a reproduction bundle so CI can re-run it:

```
answer.receipt.json         the receipt
answer.reproduction.json    {"inputs": [...same inputs...], "receipt": {...that receipt...}}
```

Then `npx guessless reproduce answer.reproduction.json` re-runs it and fails if a single byte of
the receipt was altered.

## Boundaries

JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX and TSX only. Guessless has no opinion about other languages, about
runtime behaviour, or about whether a change is _correct_ — only about whether a structural answer
is complete.

## Versionless-specific boundary

All guessless invocations here are offline-only: the CLI reads sources from the envelope and touches no network, consistent with VERSIONLESS_NETWORK_MODE=offline phases. Receipts pair naturally with this repo's own run receipts.
